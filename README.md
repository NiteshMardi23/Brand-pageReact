Project Documentation: Building a Simple React Landing Page

Introduction:
This documentation outlines the creation of a basic landing page using React. The project is divided into three main components: Page, Header, and Body. The purpose of this documentation is to provide a clear understanding of the project's structure, components, and how they interact.

Project Structure:
The project's structure is organized as follows:


project-folder
│   README.md
│   ...   
└───src
    └───Components
        ├───Header
        │       Header.js
        │       Header.module.css
        │
        ├───Body
        │       Body.js
        │       Body.module.css
        │
        └───...
1. Page Component:
This component acts as the main container for the landing page. It imports the Header and Body components and renders them within its structure.

2. Body Component:
The Body component contains the main content of the landing page, including an image carousel and informational text. It uses useState and useEffect to manage the image carousel logic, switching images at a set interval.

3. Header Component:
The Header component displays the navigation bar at the top of the page. It includes a logo, menu items, and a login button.

Conclusion:
This project serves as a foundation for creating a simple landing page using React. By examining the Page, Header, and Body components, you can gain insight into how React components can be structured, styled, and organized. Feel free to expand upon this project by adding more components, additional features, and further styling.
